# Data-Science-Radar - November 11 2022

<p>All, <br><br>
As I talked about recently, I read a lot! Mostly various shortform articles, blogs, research papers in the Data Science/ML/AI space and some adjacent topics. I have studied the Data Science Field and watched it mature throughout my professional life and I have friends who are some of the brightest writers, researchers, thinkers and practitioners in this space. This is not just a collection of random links, I have read these articles and papers in their entirety and I want to share what I think is some very intrguing content. I hope you find some of these interesting and **I always appreciate feedback**. I have used this successfully before and I want this to be just 1 more way in which we expand the knowledge base at West Monroe for Data Science.<br><br>

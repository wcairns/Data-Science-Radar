            <blockquote><p>All, <br><br>
            Welcome to the second edition. This issue is coming out a few days early as we all prepare to head to our respective Thanksgiving Celebrations and I wanted to give you all some timely Data Science news, research and articles to share with your Grandparents and Families over dinner. Some good content this time around and I am expecting a flurry of new research that gets released as Amazon's annual AWS re:Invent Conference kicks off next week in Las Vegas. <b>I always appreciate feedback</b>. so keep it coming as we collaboratively grow the knowledge base at West Monroe for Data Science.<br>
            p.s. I Hope the new site layout using Github pages is more user friendly. Happy Thanksgiving!<br>
